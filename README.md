# email-controller

Using this project as your skeleton, write a kubernetes controller that will send an email. Then, write a script that process the provided `contacts.csv` file and utilizes the API & controller you've built to send an email to each contact.

You will need to design your API (see `./api/v1alpha1/emailrequest_types.go`) and implement the `EmailRequest` controller (`./internal/controller/emailrequest_controller.go`). 

To each contact, send an email with a subject of `Hello` and a body of `Hello, {name}!`. 

A fake email service has been provided for you to use in your controller (`./pkg/fakeemail`). **Do NOT modify the fake email client.**

We expect that you will spend roughly 2 hours on this assignment, but please spend no more than 4 hours. An incomplete submission followed-up with good answers in the first interview round is better than a perfect submission and poor answers during the interview.

## Requirements
- Each email must be sent at most once
- EmailRequests should have configurable retry behavior that applies to retriable errors. This must be configurable at the API level, not controller-wide.
- Emails that are "bounced" should be treated as permanent failures and not retried.
- Emails that are "blocked" should be treated as temporary failures and retried based on the configured retry behavior.
- Invalid email addresses should be treated as permanent failures and not retried.
- Your status API for `EmailRequest` should include status conditions that indicate whether the email has been sent successfully (among any other status information you deem important to expose)

## Bonus points

Submissions that go "above and beyond" might include any or all of the following. Do note that this is optional, but encouraged, based on your available time.
- Regex-based validation of email addresses at the API level. This could be via kubebuilder markers or via a validating webhook. You can use the same regex that the fakeemail service uses: `^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$` 
- Tests that cover your controller's retry semantics and status API. See the [kubebuilder docs](https://book.kubebuilder.io/cronjob-tutorial/writing-tests) on writing tests for guidance.


## Next steps

When you have completed the assignment, please return your full implementation (the entire repo) in a zip file. A follow-up interview will then be scheduled; in this interview, among other things, we will discuss the decisions you made in your submission and what motivated these decisions.


--------------------


## Running the controller 
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster
1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -k config/samples/
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/email-controller:tag
```

3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/email-controller:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/).

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/),
which provide a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster.

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
